DOM -Document object Model
A way to access HTML code in javascript,
We use these information to change in html using javascript,
Because when we are accessing any file html cant change its code itself in runtime therefore,
we use javascript to change dynamicaaly during runtime,
This can also be called as dynamic manipulation.
